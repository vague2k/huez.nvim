INSTALLATION                                     *huez-huez.nvim-installation*

>lua
    -- Lazy
    {
        "vague2k/huez.nvim",
        -- if you want registry related features, uncomment this
        -- import = "huez-manager.import"
        config = function()
            require("huez").setup({})
        end,
    }
<


CONFIGURATION                                   *huez-huez.nvim-configuration*

Huez comes with the following defaults

>lua
    {
      path = vim.fs.normalize(vim.fn.stdpath("data") --[[@as string]]) .. "/huez",
      fallback = "default",
      suppress_messages = true,
      exclude = { "desert", "evening", "industry", "koehler", "morning", "murphy", "pablo", "peachpuff", "ron", "shine", "slate", "torte", "zellner", "blue", "darkblue", "delek", "quiet", "elflord", "habamax", "lunaperche", "zaibatsu", "wildcharm", "sorbet", "vim", },
      picker = {
        themes = {
          layout = "right",
          opts = {},
        },
        favorites = {
          layout = "right",
          opts = {},
        },
        live = {
          layout = "right",
          opts = {},
        },
        ensured = {
          layout = "right",
          opts = {},
        },
      },
    }
<


USAGE                                                   *huez-huez.nvim-usage*

All of these commands currently use telescope and opens pickers to…

  Command          Description
  ---------------- ----------------------------------------------
  :Huez            Preview installed colorschemes
  :HuezFavorites   Preview colorschemes marked as favorites
  :HuezLive        Preview and install themes from a registry
  :HuezEnsured     Preview colorschemes ensured to be installed
If you’re using Lua:

>lua
    local pickers = require("huez.pickers")
    
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>co", pickers.themes, {})
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>cof", pickers.favorites, {})
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>col", pickers.live, {})
    vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>coe", pickers.ensured, {})
<

Huez handles loading and dynamically installing/uninstalling colorschemes using
file located (by default) in `~/.local/share/nvim/huez/` or if you’re using
lua `vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/huez"`. If you changed the
|huez-configuration| opt `path`, this path is different for you.

On setup, Huez while read the `huez-theme` file in this directory, and loads
that colorscheme. If for some reason that colorscheme can’t be loaded, Huez
will fallback to using the very appropriately named |huez-configuration| opt
`fallback`. In the case that your fallback colorscheme also cannot be loaded,
huez will resort to neovim’s "default" colorscheme.


COMMANDS                                             *huez-huez.nvim-commands*


HUEZ

`:Huez` will open a picker of colorschemes that are currently installed,
omitting any colorschemes passed to |huez-configuration| opt `exclude`, where
`exclude` is usually a list of default themes that come with preinstalled with
Neovim, that are not so appealing. If you prefer one of these themes,

you can always add or remove themes from this list to change what results are
shown in the picker.

This single command has always been and always be Huez’s main and most
practical functionality

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Mapping        Action
  -------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
  <C-n>/<Down>   Preview next colorscheme

  <C-p>/<Up>     Preview previous colorscheme

  <j>/<k>        Preview next/previous colorscheme respectively (normal
                 mode)

  <esc>          Close the picker and load the persisted colorscheme
                 (normal mode)

  <CR>           Select colorscheme and persist this through neovim
                 sessions

  <space>        Add the selected colorscheme to favorites
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------

HUEZFAVORITES

Works exactly like |huez-`:huez`| except you’re dealing with colorschemes
marked as favorites. The only thing that differs is what the action the
`<space>` mapping performs

The file that contains a list of these themes can be found in
`~/.local/share/nvim/huez/huez-favorite-themes`

  Mapping   Action
  --------- ------------------------------------------------
  <space>   Remove the selected colorscheme from favorites

HUEZLIVE

`:HuezLive` opens a picker of colorschemes plugins from the registry. The idea
is you don’t have to leave Neovim to look for a new theme to try out.

To be able to use `:HuezLive` and `:HuezEnsured` without throwing errors, you
must add this line to the lazy config wherever you setup Huez.

>lua
    {
    -- ...
    import = "huez-manager.import"
    -- ...
    }
<

A colorscheme plugin from the registry can include multiple colorschemes, a
good example is cattpuccin. cattpuccin is the plugin itself, but there are 4
colorschemes that come with cattpuccin.

While traversing the picker’s results, if a colorscheme plugin only has 1
colorscheme, that will be the colorscheme that will be loaded. If the plugin
has more than 1 colorscheme, a predefined colorscheme from the plugin will be
previewed, For example

>lua
    -- base16, is the plugin that will be installed, but since it contains hundreds of colorschemes
    -- I chose "base16-default-dark" to be an appropriate default to preview
    ["base16"] = {
        url = "https://github.com/RRethy/base16-nvim",
        pkgname = "base16",
        colorscheme = "base16-default-dark",
      },
<

Traversing the picker also writes the new colorscheme plugin to be previewed to
`~/.local/share/nvim/huez/huez-live-themes` When exiting the picker, this is
file is wiped clean, effectively uninstalling all of these themes.

Note that lazy will not show that these plugins are ready to be cleaned until
the next neovim reload

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Mapping        Action
  -------------- -----------------------------------------------------------
  <C-n>/<Down>   Install and preview next colorscheme

  <C-p>/<Up>     Install and preview previous colorscheme

  <j>/<k>        Install and preview next/previous colorscheme respectively
                 (normal mode)

  <esc>          Close the picker and unload all installed colorschemes
                 (normal mode)

  <space>        Install the selected colorscheme plugin (ensure installed)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------

HUEZENSURED

`:HuezEnsured` opens a picker of colorschemes plugins that are ensured to be
installed if they are found in the registry.

The mappings are similiar to |huez-`:huez`| with the same characteristics
describe in |huez-`:huezlive`|

The file that contains the list of these themes can be found in
`~/.local/share/nvim/huez/huez-ensured-themes`

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Mapping        Action
  -------------- ---------------------------------------------------------
  <C-n>/<Down>   Preview next colorscheme

  <C-p>/<Up>     Preview previous colorscheme

  <j>/<k>        Preview next/previous colorscheme respectively (normal
                 mode)

  <esc>          Close the picker and load the persisted colorscheme
                 (normal)

  <CR>           Select colorscheme and persist this through neovim
                 sessions

  <space>        Uninstall the selected colorscheme plugin
